# Coolpc-WebCrawler

this is the final Project for course: \<Introduction to Computers and Programming\>(NCTU 2021 Fall). 
I made a web crawler to get information from coolpc's website. which is a popular website for purchasing computer hardware.

the crawler has following feature:
* present infomation of commodities
* present price analysis graph
* able to add items to collection list (online googlesheet)
* provide further information about commodity via google search api

2023/11 edit: coolpc had changed their website architecture, further update await...
